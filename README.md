# <Prework Study Guide>

## Description


I built this project to better help myself become familiar with all the components of git,HTML,CSS,and JavaScript. I was motivated to complete this project because I am curious as to how developers create a flow and work on projects. This project contains notes that can help problem solve deployement and git issues along with simple HTML,CSS, and Java syntax/structure.
